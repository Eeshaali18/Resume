        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>As a driven 1st-year Computer Science student at IBA and a small business owner dedicated to providing donations to Animal Shelters, I hold a keen interest in web development and tech entrepreneurship. My primary focus is on enhancing my technical skills and, above all, continuous learning. With additional experience in content writing, I am open to exploring diverse fields. Combining hands-on expertise in customer relations and marketing with my technical skills has honed my attention to detail and fostered a self-driven approach. I am enthusiastic about applying my skills in a professional setting, where I can learn from industry experts and contribute to meaningful change in the tech sector.</p>
